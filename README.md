# Load Test

This repository contains scripts and configurations for benchmarking a PostgreSQL database using `pgbench`. The focus is on testing various SQL queries to evaluate performance under different loads.

## Command

### Restore Database

```bash
pg_restore -U postgres -d dvdrental /data/dvdrental.tar
```

### Send SQL

```bash
pgbench -h postgres-test -p 5432 -U postgres -d dvdrental -c 60 -T 10 -f test/02_simple_select.sql --no-vacuum
```

## Threshold

### 01. Simple Select (PK Access)

#### Query

```
\set random_id random(1, 599)
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE customer_id = :random_id;
```

#### Result

![01_simple_select_result](results/01_simple_select_result.png)

- Based on CPU utilization, the optimal connection pool size is 2.
- Based on TPS performance, the optimal connection pool size is 20.
- Latency begins to increase noticeably beyond 20 clients, but memory usage increases linearly and does not become a bottleneck in this test.



### 02. Search by Title (ILIKE)

#### Query

```
\set alpha_id random(65, 90)
SELECT * FROM film WHERE title ILIKE '%' || chr(:alpha_id) || '%';
```

#### Result

![02_search_by_title](results/02_search_by_title.png)

- The ILIKE operation triggers either a full table scan or, at best, a partial index scan.
As a result, query performance is significantly lower compared to primary key lookups.
- TPS (transactions per second) drops sharply relative to simple PK queries, and latency increases substantially, especially as concurrency rises.
- As the number of concurrent requests grows, the inefficiency of the LIKE/ILIKE query accumulates: TPS plateaus or even decreases, while latency escalates exponentially under heavy load.
- Pattern-matching queries like this can become major bottlenecks in high-traffic environments, and should be avoided or optimized through pre-filtering, indexing strategies, or full-text search solutions if possible.



### 03. Customer Last Rental (Order By)

#### Query

```
\set random_id random(1, 599)
SELECT * FROM rental WHERE customer_id = :random_id ORDER BY rental_date DESC LIMIT 1;
```
### Result

![03_customer_last_rental](results/03_customer_last_rental.png)

- Based on CPU utilization, the optimal connection pool size is 2.
- Based on memory usage, there is no significant increase.
- Based on TPS performance, the optimal connection pool size is 20.
- Based on latency, there is no significant increase.
- Indexing the `rental_date` column significantly improves performance.



### 04. Count Rental per Customer (Group By)

#### Query

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS rental_count FROM rental GROUP BY customer_id;
```

#### Result

![04_count_rental_per_customer](results/04_count_rental_per_customer.png)

- CPU utilization reaches its maximum with just 2 connections.
- Memory usage increases gradually but does not show abrupt spikes.
- TPS performance plateaus around 10 connections, with a maximum TPS of ~875, which is significantly lower than simple queries.
- Latency increases sharply beyond 10 connections.
- **Group By queries are highly resource-intensive**: TPS drops by 10-20x compared to primary key lookups, making them less suitable for high-concurrency environments.



### 05. Film Rental History (Join)

#### Query

```sql
\set random_film_id random(1, 1000)
SELECT f.title, r.rental_date, c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM rental r
JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
JOIN film f ON i.film_id = f.film_id
JOIN customer c ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE f.film_id = :random_film_id
ORDER BY r.rental_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Result

![05_film_rental_history](results/05_film_rental_history.png)

- CPU utilization reaches its maximum (200%) with just 2 concurrent connections, indicating full resource saturation.
- Memory usage increases steadily as the number of clients grows, but there are no abrupt spikes or out-of-memory risks in this test.
- TPS (transactions per second) peaks at around 3,400 with 5~10 connections, then slightly decreases as concurrency increases further.
- Latency remains low at low concurrency, but increases sharply beyond 10 connections, reaching nearly 30ms at 90 clients.
- Proper indexing dramatically improves join query performance: Efficient use of indexes keeps latency low and TPS high compared to group-by queries, even under higher load.



### 06. Top 10 Film (Join + Group By)

#### Query

```sql
SELECT f.film_id, f.title, COUNT(*) AS rental_count
FROM rental r
JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
JOIN film f ON i.film_id = f.film_id
GROUP BY f.film_id, f.title
ORDER BY rental_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Result

- [06_top10_film.png](results/06_top10_film.png)

- CPU utilization quickly reaches its maximum (200%) with just 2 concurrent connections, indicating immediate resource saturation for this workload.
- Memory usage increases steadily as client concurrency grows, but there are no abrupt spikes or out-of-memory issues observed within this test window.
- TPS (transactions per second) peaks at approximately 300 with 5 concurrent connections, then gradually declines as concurrency increases, reflecting the heavy computational load of the group-by aggregation.
- Latency rises sharply with increasing concurrency: it remains moderate up to 10 clients (~34ms), but escalates to over 330ms at 90 clients, illustrating significant response time degradation under heavy load.
- Compared to indexed join queries, this complex group-by query results in much lower TPS and higher latency, highlighting that group-by and aggregation operations are major performance bottlenecks in high-concurrency environments.



### 07. Update Customer (Update)

#### Query

```sql
\set random_id random(1, 599)
UPDATE customer SET address_id = (
    SELECT address_id FROM address
    OFFSET floor(random() * (SELECT count(*) FROM address))
    LIMIT 1
) WHERE customer_id = :random_id;
```

#### Result

![07_update_customer](results/07_update_customer.png)

- CPU utilization climbs toward its maximum (200%) as client concurrency increases, but remains below saturation until around 10 clients, showing lower immediate pressure compared to group-by queries.
- Memory usage increases steadily with higher concurrency, and shows a slightly larger growth trend than read-only queries, but no abrupt spikes or out-of-memory issues are observed during this test.
- TPS (transactions per second) peaks at approximately 3,600 with 10 concurrent connections, then gradually decreases as concurrency increases, indicating some lock contention and write bottlenecks as load grows.
- Latency remains low and stable up to moderate concurrency, but increases noticeably beyond 20 clients, reaching ~31ms at 90 clients.
- Compared to complex group-by and join queries, this single-row UPDATE operation demonstrates much higher TPS and lower latency under load, reflecting that single-row writes are more efficient and less resource-intensive as long as row-level contention is minimal.

### 08. Insert Customer (Insert)

#### Query

```sql
\set random_id random(1, 1000000)
\set store_id random(1, 2)
INSERT INTO customer (store_id, first_name, last_name, email, address_id, active)
VALUES (
  :store_id,
  'first_' || :random_id,
  'last_'  || :random_id,
  'test'   || :random_id || '@example.com',
  (SELECT address_id FROM address OFFSET floor(random() * (SELECT count(*) FROM address)) LIMIT 1),
  1
);
```

#### Result

![08_insert_customer](results/08_insert_customer.png)

- CPU utilization climbs toward its maximum (200%) as client concurrency increases, but stays below saturation until around 10 clients, demonstrating lower immediate pressure compared to heavy group-by or join queries.
- Memory usage rises steadily with higher concurrency, showing a moderate growth trend similar to UPDATE operations; however, there are no abrupt spikes or out-of-memory incidents during this test.
- TPS (transactions per second) peaks at approximately 7,000 with 20â€“50 concurrent connections, then gradually decreases as concurrency increases further, indicating the system reaches its write throughput limit and some lock contention emerges.
- Latency remains very low and stable up to moderate concurrency, only increasing beyond 50 clients, and still stays within acceptable levels (peaking at ~14ms with 90 clients).
- Compared to complex group-by, join, or update queries, this single-row INSERT operation delivers much higher TPS and lower latency under load, highlighting that single-row insertions are highly efficient and scale well as long as there is minimal contention and index/constraint overhead.
